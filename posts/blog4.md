### Introduction

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Before we model incumbency, we can perform some exploratory data analysis to help us decide what to include in our model.

According to this graph, the benefits of incumbency vary across swing states and non-swing states. For presidential elections since 1984, incumbents have less of an advantage in swing states. The mean incumbent voteshare in non-swing states is higher than the mean incumbent voteshare in swing states, and is about equal to the 75% percentile incumbent voteshare in swing states. The range is also wider for non-swing states, which is likely due there being fewer swing states.
This is perhaps intuitive: because the winning party in swing states changes from election to election, swing state voters probably cares slightly less about which party holds the title of incumbent. 
It is worth noting that swing states in this dataset are defined by which states were regarded as swing states for each respective election, rather than a singular list.
